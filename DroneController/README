The DroneController folder is a collection of Makefiles and source code to act
as a build framework for ACE and MADARA as well as facilitate the connection
between MADARA and the AR.Drone 2.

Included in DroneController:
1) Makefile to cross-compile ACE
2) Makefile to cross-compile MADARA
3) Makefile to cross-compile OpenCV (Currently Broken)
4) Makefile to cross-compile OpenSSH
5) Makefile to cross-compile WPA Supplicant
6) Code to test OpenCV
7) madara_client


===========================
Setup / Installation
===========================

NOTE: DroneController is intended for use only on Linux, and has only been
      tested on Ubuntu

1) Ensure the following packages are installed on your system:
	cmake
	git
	subversion
	ia32-libs (if on a 64-bit system)

2) Obtain the arm-2009q1-176 toolchain from the following URL (you will have
   to register):
http://www.mentor.com/embedded-software/sourcery-tools/sourcery-codebench/editions/lite-edition/request?id=478dff82-62bc-44b2-afe2-4684d83b19b9&downloadlite=scblite2012&fmpath=/embedded-software/sourcery-tools/sourcery-codebench/editions/lite-edition/form

3) Modify the LOCAL_CROSS variable in toolchain.mk to point to the folder you
   placed the cross compiler in

4) Build a package with the following command executed from the DroneController
   directory:
	make <package name>

5) After building a package, you will need to deploy it on the AR.Drone 2:
	a) Connect to the drone's WiFi network
	b) Use FTP to push any libraries or binaries to the drone
	c) Use Telnet to open a shell on the drone.
	d) Create the /data/lib directory
	e) Create the /data/bin
	f) Move any libraries to /data/lib and any executables to /data/bin
	g) Change the permissions to 755 on all of the libraries and executables
	h) Link the libraries to the /lib directory with "ln -s"
	i) Link the executables to the /bin directory with "ln -s"
