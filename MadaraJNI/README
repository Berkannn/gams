Installation:

1) Compile or install ACE using the directions found at the Madara website.
2) Copy the jni folder to $(MADARA_ROOT)/include/madara/jni
3) Modify $(MADARA_ROOT)/MADARA.mwc
	Located the line "includes += $(MADARA_ROOT)/include" near the top
	of the file, and add the following two lines after it:
	includes += $(JAVA_HOME)/include
	includes += $(JAVA_HOME)/include/linux
	
	Make sure to modify the second line according to the OS you are
	compiling MADARA for.
	
	Locate the Source_Files list and add the following line to the list:
	include/madara/jni
4) Compile Madara according to directions on the website
5) Add lib/MadaraJNI.jar to your Java project
6) Make sure your execution enviroment links against libMADARA and libACE.
	This can be acomplished by either installing the libraries to the
	correct system directories or by setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your
	execution enviroment. In the case of Eclipse, right click on the
	project and click Run As->Run Configurations. Select the
	Run Configuration for your project and add LD_LIBRARY_PATH as a
	variable in the Enviroment tab
